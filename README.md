# One Time Password Example

This is a one time password backend example. It only includes the login/authentication part, it's not a complete solution. It was originally written to demo proof of concept/implementation. I was going to turn it into a tutorial but I got busy. Thanks!

To get this running:

```bash
DB_USERNAME=*
DB_PASSWORD=*
DB_DATABASE=*
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=*
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=*
JWT_SECRET=*
```

GET /users (protected)
POST /users
